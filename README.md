# ML_TM_SCR_Synthesis
This repository contains code and resources for the project titled "Machine Learning and Text Mining Approaches to Design Selective Catalyst Reduction (SCR) Synthesis Routes". The work integrates natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) techniques to extract, analyze, and model synthesis routes for SCR catalysts from scientific literature.
