      "The C2H2-SCR reaction was carried out in a quartz reactor (i.d. 4mm) at atmospheric pressure. A mixture of 1600ppm NO, 800ppm C2H2, 10% O2 in He with a total flow rate of 50mlmin−1 was fed through 0.2g catalyst (GHSV≈ 8000h−1). NO conversion was calculated from the amount of produced N2 as analyzed by GC (HP 6890) using a capillary column (HP–PLOT/zeolite 30m×0.32mm×12μm). For comparison, 1600ppm of CH4 and 533ppm of C3H6 (in the same carbon concentration) were used as reductant instead of C2H2.\n",
      "To correlate the activity of the catalyst for C2H2-SCR of NO and that for NO oxidation, the behavior of the catalyst in the individual NO oxidation was investigated by passing a gas mixture of 200ppm NO and 10% O2 in N2, through 0.2g of catalyst at a rate of 100mlmin−1. Both the produced NO2 and the unreacted NO were analyzed by means of an electro-chemical NO                            x                          analyzer (ACY301-B). All reaction data were taken at steady state (that was generally reached in 40min at each selected temperature).\n",
      "The catalysts were pelleted and sieved to 50–80 mesh before being loaded in a fixed-bed reactor. 500 ppm NH3, 500 ppm NO, 5% O2 and 3% H2O were balanced with N2 to simulate the diesel exhaust gas. All pipes of the reactor were heated above 100°C to avoid water condensation. The total flow rate was 1 L/min and the catalyst mass was 250 mg for each test (GHSV = 120,000 hr−1). 175°C was selected as the SCR test temperature and the catalysts were kept at 175°C for at least 30 min in each test to ensure reaction equilibrium. After the 175°C SCR test with pre-impregnated urea, deactivated catalyst was obtained. To investigate regeneration methods, the deactivated catalyst was treated at different temperatures under SCR conditions for 30 min, and then cooled to 175°C for another SCR test. The concentrations of NO, NO2, N2O, NH3, CO2 and HNCO in the outlet gas were measured by a Fourier transform infrared gas analyzer (MKS 2030, USA). NO                            x                          conversion was calculated by Eq. (6) based on the concentrations of NO, NO2 and N2O.

      "After the SCR tests at 175°C, the catalysts were cooled down to room temperature in N2 flow, and then parts of the catalysts were sampled for characterization by temperature programmed hydrolysis and in-situ DRIFTS.\n",
      "To determine the relative SCR activity of each zeolite sample, catalytic activity tests employing using a fixed-bed quartz flow reactor employing test samples (1.6 mL or 0.4 mL, 40–60 mesh). The feed gas in these tests was comprised of 600 ppm each of NO and NH3, 2.5% O2, with argon (Ar) providing the balance of the gas. To generate a gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 37,500 h−1 or 150,000 h−1 a total flow rate of 1000 mL/min was maintained. The inlet and outlet gas concentrations of NO, NO2, NH3 and N2O were measured using a GASMET DX4000 analyzer. The NOx removal efficiency and the N2 selectivity were obtained by the following equations (1) and (2):                                                           (1)

NOxoutlet, NH3outlet and N2Ooutlet correspond to the outlet concentrations (ppm) of NOx, NH3 and N2O, respectively.\n",
      "To examine the effect of ceria on the catalysts for NO removal by NH3, catalyst performance was evaluated in terms of NO conversion (shown in Fig. 5                         ). It was clearly found that the addition of ceria expanded drastically the temperature window for SCR reaction and improved the catalytic performance. The temperature at which 90% NO was converted was decreased to about 200°C in the case of CeO2 modified V/Ti–Zr in comparison with V/Ti–Zr catalyst. The effect of different ceria loadings for catalytic activity was also measured. The catalytic performance was enhanced with the CeO2 loading, increasing until the loading grew up to mol.20% and then declined slightly. Among all the samples tested, V–20Ce/Ti–Zr catalyst exhibited the best performance with nearly 100% of NO conversion in the wide temperature range of 210–450°C. Above 450°C, the catalytic activity of all catalysts was attenuated due to the ammonia oxidation 40 to NO2, a more poisonous air pollutant in comparison with NO.\n",
      "Many researchers have studied the mechanism of the SCR reaction and agree that ammonia is strongly adsorbed and activated on the surface acid sites of the catalysts and later react with gas-phase or weakly adsorbed NO molecules. Recalling the discussion about NH3-adsorbed in situ FT-IR, the greater amount of surface acidic and active intermediate that the Ce-containing catalysts possessed ensured their higher activities in the reaction. Particularly, the best catalytic performance of the 20Ce–V/Ti–Zr sample was in good agreement with the FT-IR results.\n",
      "The C2H2-SCR reaction was carried out in a quartz reactor (i.d. 4mm) at atmospheric pressure. A mixture of 1600ppm NO, 800ppm C2H2, 10% O2 in He with a total flow rate of 50mlmin−1 was fed through the catalyst 0.2g (GHSV≈8500h−1). NO conversion was calculated from the amount of N2 produced in the reaction as analyzed by GC (HP 6890) using a capillary column (HP–PLOT/zeolite 30m×0.32mm×12μm), since no nitrous oxide was observed over all catalysts tested in the study. C2H2 conversion was measured by another GC with a capillary column (HP-PLOT/Al2O3, 30m×0.53mm×15μm). For comparison, 1600ppm of CH4 or 533ppm of C3H6 (in the same carbon concentration as that of C2H2) was used as reducing agent instead of the 800ppm of C2H2.\n",
      "When acetylene or methane was used as reducing agent, all reaction data were collected at steady state (that was generally reached in 40min at each selected reaction temperature). However, in the case of C3H6-SCR, the data were taken at the time when the reaction just conducted for 40min at each selected temperature, due to the catalysts’ rapid deactivation.\n",
      "To check the relation between the activities of the catalyst for C2H2-SCR of NO and for NO oxidation, the behavior of the catalyst in the individual NO oxidation was investigated by passing a gas mixture of 200ppm NO and 9.95% O2 in N2, through 0.2g of catalyst sample at a total flow rate of 100mlmin−1. Both the produced NO2 and the unreacted NO were analyzed by means of an electro-chemical NO                            x                          analyzer (ACY301-B). All data were collected at steady reaction state.\n",
      "The individual test for measuring the activity of the catalyst for C2H2 combustion was carried out in a reaction system containing 800ppm C2H2, 9.95% O2 in He. At each selected temperature, the gas mixture was passed through the catalyst sample 0.2g at total flow rate of 50mlmin−1, and the effluent gas was analyzed by a GC.\n",
      "The ammonia conversion (%) as a function of time (h) is presented at Fig. 3                          for the conventional catalysts and at Fig. 4                          for the ME-prepared catalysts. The results from the second ramping cycle are always reported. The activity tests were repeated twice for confirmation of the results. The four main steps appeared on the ammonia conversion curves represent the four 30-min dwellings at inlet catalyst temperature of 500, 600, 700 and 750°C.\n",
      "The activity test results regarding the catalysts prepared by conventional method showed that catalysts prepared by IW of Ni had high activity and nitrogen selectivity, that is 92% NH3 conversion and 99% selectivity to N2 at 750°C (for the 10% Ni/Ce0.9La0.1O2 catalyst). This catalyst was even active at 500°C obtaining 36% NH3 conversion. The activity values at 750 and 500°C were lower for the catalysts prepared by Ni co-precipitation (85 and 13% NH3 conversion, respectively, for the Ni0.1Ce0.82La0.08O2 catalyst), whereas N2 selectivity remained at same level. The activity measurements have also shown that there was some selectivity towards NO2 formation for all the catalysts at lower temperature (500°C), especially for the Ni0.05Ce0.86La0.09O2, where NO2 selectivity was 16%.\n",
      "Regarding the catalysts prepared by ME method, activity test results showed higher activity than the conventional ones. Catalysts prepared by IW of Ni had exceptionally high activity and nitrogen selectivity at 750°C, that is 98% NH3 conversion and 99% selectivity to N2 (for the 10% Ni/Ce0.9La0.1O2 catalyst). At 500°C, NH3 conversion for the same catalyst was 61%. The catalysts prepared by Ni co-precipitation had slightly lower NH3 conversion, which was 84 and 24% at 750 and 500°C, respectively, for the Ni0.1Ce0.82La0.08O2. The N2 selectivity was decreased, especially for the Ni0.05Ce0.86La0.09O2 catalyst, which at low temperature (500°C) had 38% N2 selectivity, leading to NO and NO2 formation. At this point, it is important to mention that at low temperature (500°C), conventional catalysts promoted the slight formation of NO2 whereas the ME-prepared catalyst favoured the slightly the formation of NO.\n",
      "Having a closer look at Figs. 3 and 4, it is important to point out that the ME-prepared catalysts maintained constant NH3 conversion during dwelling at different temperatures at the second ramping cycle. On the other hand, conventional catalysts had a decline of NH3 conversion (catalyst deactivation) during the dwelling at all temperature levels. A common activity behaviour is that all the catalysts, regardless of the preparation method appear to have same activity sequence (lowest→highest NH3 conversion): Ni0.05Ce0.86La0.09O2                         <Ni0.1Ce0.82La0.08O2                         <5% Ni/Ce0.9La0.1O2                         <10% Ni/Ce0.9La0.1O2. That concludes that IW of Ni resulted in better catalysts (higher NH3 conversion) than Ni co-precipitation, and that the more the Ni load on the catalysts, the higher the activity.\n",
      "Figs. 5 and 6                                                   show the N2 yield (%) on conventional and ME-prepared catalysts, as the function of the inlet catalyst temperature. It can be seen at both graphs at IW impregnation of Ni offered higher N2 yield than Ni co-precipitation. In the case of the ME-prepared catalysts, N2 yield was already at higher level (59%) than the conventional ones (35%), especially at lower temperatures (500°C). As well as at high temperatures (750°C), ME-prepared catalysts had substantially improved N2 yield than the conventional ones.\n",
      "Having an overall look at the activity test results, it can be summarised that catalysts synthesised by IW of Ni showed higher catalytic activity regarding ammonia conversion and higher nitrogen selectivity comparing to catalysts prepared by Ni co-precipitation. This behaviour could be seen for the catalysts prepared by both preparation methods (conventional and ME). Additionally, the more Ni was impregnated (by IW), the higher the conversion and selectivity obtained. This tendency was also observed at the values obtained by the Ni co-precipitated catalysts (Ni0.05Ce0.86La0.09O2 and Ni0.1Ce0.82La0.08O2).\n",
      "Regarding the conventional catalysts, the ammonia conversion at low temperature (500°C) varied between 6 and 36%, depending on the catalyst. As the temperature increased, the NH3 conversion increased, respectively, for all the catalysts, but during the 30-min dwelling at different temperatures, a slight decrease in activity was observed. Dwelling at high temperatures (750°C), an extensive decrease in conversion was observed for both Ni0.05Ce0.86La0.09O2 and Ni0.1Ce0.82La0.08O2 catalysts, whereas the catalysts prepared by IW of Ni were rather stable (constant conversion). Ten percent Ni/Ce0.9La0.1O2 had the best performance and constant conversion (92%), while Ni0.05Ce0.86La0.09O2 was unstable (decrease in conversion) during the dwelling and had lowest ammonia conversion at 500 and 750°C (6 and 71%, respectively).\n",
      "ME-prepared catalysts though showed even better catalytic activity regarding ammonia conversion and similar nitrogen selectivity comparing to the conventional prepared catalysts. Likewise, IW of Ni resulted in the formation of catalysts that had better results than the Ni co-precipitated catalysts. IW of 10% Ni gave the best performance at all temperature ranges, whereas Ni0.05Ce0.86La0.09O2 had the lowest ammonia conversion at all temperature ranges. On the other hand, all catalysts were very stable (constant conversion) during the activity tests at all temperatures.\n",
      "For all the catalysts prepared by IW, the more Ni is impregnated, the higher the conversion and selectivity values, especially at low temperature (500°C). At 750°C, the ammonia conversion was almost the same (98%) for both 5 and 10% Ni/Ce0.9La0.1O2. That trend could not be seen though by Ni co-precipitated catalysts. Generally, the ammonia conversion varied at low temperature (500°C) between 3 and 61%, depending on the preparation technique, which was a wider activity range than that of the conventional catalysts (6 and 36%).\n",
      "N2 yield is very high for all the catalysts. Particular interest have the Ni co-precipitated catalysts synthesised by both conventional and ME method (Ni0.05Ce0.86La0.09O2) where at 500°C nitrogen selectivity was much lower (80 and 38%, respectively), resulting in NO                            x                          formation. All the other remaining catalysts had approximately 94% nitrogen selectivity at 500°C and very little NO                            x                          formation.\n",
      "Regarding the carbon formation, conventional catalysts formed carbon residues during tests unlikely to the ME-prepared catalysts, which formed only very small traces. The carbon deposition around the monolith was optically observed after the activity tests. This is a great advantage since carbon formation during the activity test can result to CO and CO2 production poisoning at the same time the monolith by blocking its channels.\n",
      "The catalytic activity tests of the Mo-V-based SCR catalyst in terms of different TiO2 supports and calcination temperatures were conducted in a fixed-bed reactor system as illustrated in Fig. 1                          to evaluate their Hg0 oxidation and NO reduction efficiencies. Hg0 vapor was brought into the system by introducing 100 mL/min N2 through a mercury permeation tube (VICI Metronics) located in a calibration gas generator oven (Dynacalibrator, VICI Metronics) and ∼15 ppbv Hg0 was used as a typical inlet concentration. All of the simulated flue gas constituents regulated through mass flow controllers were produced using gas cylinders and specified in Results and Discussions part. Water vapor was fed into the system through controlling the temperature of a water bubbler. The total flow rate of the simulated coal combustion flue gas was fixed at 1 L/min. Typically, a quartz reactor with a 16 mm inner diameter containing ∼1.72 g of catalyst pellets was used to conduct the activity tests. The quartz reactor was placed in the center of a vertical oven equipped with a temperature controller. These tests were run under a gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 40,000 hr−1 at 350 °C to examine the catalytic activities of Hg0 oxidation and NO reduction in terms of different TiO2 supports and calcination temperatures 16. When the effect of GHSV on the activities was investigated, a different catalyst amount was used to set the GHSV inside the reactor.\n",
      "During all the catalytic activity tests, a cold vapor atomic absorption spectrophotometer (CVAAS, Model 400A, Buck Scientific Inc.) combined with Ontario Hydro Method was used to measure mercury concentrations at the inlet and outlet of the system. Two different impinger solutions: 1 M KCl and 4%(w/v) KMnO4/10% (v/v) H2SO4 were employed to collect oxidized mercury and Hg0 vapor, respectively. A Micro Emission Analyzer (Model 500, Enerac LLC) was employed to determine NO inlet and outlet concentrations. The activities of Hg0 oxidation and NO reduction were calculated based on the inlet and outlet Hg0 and NO concentrations as shown below.

      "Catalysts pelleted to 50–80 meshes were used to test their activities in SCR and NH3 oxidation between 150 and 550 °C. For each test, 250 mg catalyst was loaded in a fixed-bed reactor, and a pretreatment in 21% O2/N2 at 550 °C for 20 min was conducted. Afterwards, 500 ppm NO (w/o)/ 500 ppm NH3/5% O2/3% H2O/N2 was cut in, and the total flow rate was kept at 1.0 L/min to maintain a GHSV of 120,000 h−1. Concentrations of NO, NH3, NO2 and N2O in outlet gas were monitored by a Nicolet 380 Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) gas analyzer (ThermoFisher, USA). The conversions of NO                            x                          and NH3 were calculated by Eqs. (2) and (3), respectively. Note that Eq. (2) is based on N balance and the factor “2″ of N2Oout represents two unconverted N atoms in this gas, which was also adopted by other groups (e.g., Refs. 2;6).

      "A detailed experimental procedure and calculation formula can be found in our previous work 14. NO deep oxidation was carried out in a fixed-bed reactor with an internal diameter of 5.8 mm and a length of 120 mm. The total gas flow rate was 2 L/min, with an oxygen concentration of 2.5 vol%, and the corresponding residence time in the reactor was ∼0.12 s. The initial NO concentration was fixed at 410 mg/m3 with a small amount of residual NO2 in the cylinder. The O3-O2 mixture that was generated from a dielectric-barrier-discharge ozone generator (HTU-500, 1 g/h, AZCO, Canada) was injected separately into the catalyst bed to avoid a reaction between the NO and O3 before catalyst contact. The inlet and residual ozone concentrations were detected by a high- (BMT-964 BT, OSTI Inc.; 0–200000 mg/m3, ±100 mg/m3) and a low-concentration ozone analyzer (Model 205, 2B Technologies; 0–430 mg/m3 ± 0.002 mg/m3), respectively. The initial and outlet concentrations of the gas components, including NO, NO2, and O2, were measured by using a Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy gas analyzer (Gasmet, O2 was measured by the external oxygen analyzer). Because of the short lifetime of N2O5, no commercial instrument exists to measure the quantitative N2O5 concentration. Previous work 13,14 has indicated that N2O5 is the only remaining product during deep oxidation. The catalytic activity was expressed by the residual concentration of NO + NO2. The conversion efficiency (NO and NO2 to N2O5) was calculated from a previous equation 14.\n",
      "Firstly, 0.3 g of monometallic metal oxides were arranged in the deep-oxidation reactor without any dilution. The conversion efficiencies at 70 °C varied with O3/NO ratio. All results were recorded after a 10-min stabilization period. Then, 2.2 g of manganese oxide-based catalysts were arranged in the same reactor, and the catalytic reaction temperature was fixed at 100 °C, unless otherwise noted. The ozone injection amount was fixed at 642 mg/m3 to ensure an O3/NO molar ratio of 1.5. Because of the spherical design, some space was excluded between these catalyst pellets. This resulted in a longer catalytic reaction time (0.12 s) or gas-solid contact time, compared with traditional powder catalysts, which are believed to play a critical role to improve performance.\n",
      "A fixed-bed quartz flow reactor was used for activity tests, using powder samples (0.9mL). The reactor gas concentrations were 800ppm each of NO and NH3, 5% O2, 10% H2O (when used), with argon (Ar) used to balance. A gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 40,000h−1 was produced by a total flow rate of 600mL/min. Inlet and outlet gas concentrations of NO, NO2, and NOx were measured using a NOx analyzer (42i-HL, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA, USA). The product N2 concentration was monitored using a gas chromatograph (GC9560, Shanghai Huaai Chromatography Analysis Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) with TCD and a 5A molecular sieve column.\n",
      "A quartz flow tube reactor, according to 3, was used in the activity tests. The Ag/alumina catalyst was tested under steady-state conditions in the temperature range 150–600 °C. The temperature of the catalyst bed was monitored by a K-type thermocouple connected to a temperature controller (Eurotherm 900 EPC). A basic gas mixture consisting of 500 ppm NO, 375 ppm octane, 6 vol% O2, 10 vol% CO2, 350 ppm CO, and 12 vol% H2O in He (GHSV = 60,000 h−1 and volumetric flow rate = 550 ml/min) was used in the activity tests. The effect of hydrogen was studied by adding 1 vol% H2 to the basic gas mixture. All gases (AGA) were of high purity and introduced into the reactor by means of mass-flow controllers (Brooks 5850E). Water was added to the gas mixture using a syringe pump in combination with a controlled evaporator mixer (Bronkhorst HI-TEC). Octane was also introduced using a syringe pump (CMA 102/Microdialysis).\n",
      "A commercial Pt oxidation catalyst (Johnson Matthey) was placed directly after the Ag/alumina catalyst in some experiments to prove the gas-phase reactions.\n",
      "The concentrations of N2, CO2, CO, and O2 were determined with the aid of a gas chromatograph (HP 6890) and the concentration changes of NO                            x                          (NO + NO2) in the gas mixture were recorded by a chemiluminescence NO                            x                          analyzer (API 200AH). Two condensers, kept at                             −                            5                             °C                          and at                             −                            25                             °C                         , were used to trap out the water from the gas prior to analysis.\n",
      "In our previous study 7 it was shown that the 2 wt% Ag/alumina is a very active catalyst for the reduction of NO using octane as reducing agent. However, the activity is limited to temperatures above 300 °C. As reported by Satokawa 5, hydrogen significantly enhances the HC-SCR reaction, especially at low temperatures. In order to investigate the effect of hydrogen on the NO conversion, 1 vol% H2 was added to the basic gas mixture and the result compared to conversions obtained without H2 is shown in Fig. 2                         . As can be seen, conversion values close to 60% were recorded already at 250 °C in the presence of hydrogen. On the other hand, hydrogen alone exhibited practically no capacity to reduce NO to N2.\n",
      "A substantial amount of carbon monoxide is formed in parallel with the NO to N2 conversion 7. The CO can easily be removed by using an oxidation catalyst. However, adding an oxidation catalyst directly after the Ag/alumina bed reduces the NO                            x                          conversion dramatically as shown in Fig. 3                         . Interestingly, addition of 1 vol% H2 to the feed reduces almost completely the contribution of the gas-phase reaction to the conversion of NO to N2, as visualized in Fig. 4                         . The rather high NO conversion at 150 °C (over 30%) with H2 in the feed is due to the activity of the oxidation catalyst. According to a test with only the oxidation catalyst, the activity at temperatures higher than 150 °C can be related to the Ag/alumina catalyst. It seems that the hydrogen effect is either due to increased reaction rate of surface reactions or reactions in the gas phase (the reactions are completed already in the pores and in the void space between particles). The role of hydrogen will be dealt with more in detail later in this study.\n",
      "The weight of Ir–Ba/WO3–SiO2 used was 0.02–0.25g. The Ir catalyst was used with and without mixing with 0.02–1g of SiO2 (Q50, Fuji Silysia Chemical Ltd.). Prior to mixing, the SiO2 was calcined at 1200°C for 3h and had a BET surface area of 1m2/g. The mixing of SiO2 with the Ir catalyst was carried out by stirring with a spatula.\n",
      "The catalytic activity for CO-SCR was measured with a conventional fixed-bed reactor. The flow rate of the feed gas was 200–400mL/min. The feed gas composition was 220ppm NO, 3100ppm CO, 10% O2, and 7% H2O with N2 as a balance gas. Before the catalytic activity tests, the catalysts were treated in 10% H2/N2 at 700°C for 1h and then in 6% H2O/N2 at 600°C for 1h. The temperature dependence of the catalytic activity was measured stepwise from 400°C to 150°C in intervals of 20°C. At each temperature, the effluent gas was sampled after the temperature had been maintained for 1h. Concentrations of NO, NO2, N2O, CO, and CO2 in the reactant and product gases were analyzed with a Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrometer (Nexus 470; Nicolet) equipped with a multi-reflectance gas cell (Nicolet; optical path length, 2m) and a deuterated triglycine sulfate (DTGS) detector.\n",
      "We performed another set of activity tests for detailed analysis of the CO-SCR products. For these tests, the weight ratio of Ir–Ba/WO3–SiO2 and SiO2 used was 1:10. The flow rate of the feed gas was 50–250mL/min. The feed gas composition was 260ppm NO, 3300ppm CO, 0–1% O2, and 1% H2O with He as a balance gas. The O2 concentration used here was lower than that used in the first set of experiments so that higher concentrations of possible intermediate species could be detected. The sample pretreatment described above was carried out for this set of experiments. The products were analyzed with a micro gas chromatograph (M200, Agilent) equipped with an MS-5A PLOT column for N2 and CO detection, a Pora PLOT Q column for N2O and CO2 detection, and with an FT-IR (Nicolet, Magna 560; resolution set at 0.5cm−1) equipped with a multi-reflectance gas cell (Gemini Specialty Optics; optical path length, 2m) and a mercury–cadmium–telluride (MCT) detector for the analysis of NO, NO2, NH3, and HNCO.\n",

      "Selective catalytic reduction by NH3 (NH3-SCR) was also carried out in the fixed-bed reactor. The flow rate of the feed gas was 400mL/min. The feed gas composition was 210ppm NO, 220ppm NH3, 10% O2, and 7% H2O with N2 as a balance gas. Pretreatment and product analysis were carried out in the manner used for CO-SCR activity measurements.\n",
      "The NO oxidation tests were conducted in isothermal mode in the same system for NOx-TPD experiments mentioned above. The feed gas contained 650 ppm NO and 5% O2 in N2 (total flow 254 mL min−1) and 200 mg of catalyst was used. The temperature range for the oxidation was 150–400 °C. At each temperature, the stabilization time was about 20–30 min for reaching the steady state reaction in order to avoid the adsorption/desorption effect of NOx on catalysts. NO oxidation was also performed in the temperature ramping mode, in this case the reaction conditions matched those of the NOx-assisted soot oxidation: the feed gas contained 500 ppm NO and 4% O2 in N2 with total flow 600 mL min−1 and 200 mg of catalyst with ramping rate 5 °C min−1. Besides the LaAl1-xCoxO3 catalysts Pt/Al2O3 with 5% Pt loading (Sigma-Aldrich 205974) was used as commercial reference.\n",
      "The activity of the catalysts in NOx-assisted soot oxidation tests was determined by Temperature Programmed Reaction (TPR) with heating rate of 5 °C min−1. The soot oxidation was studied by mixing 20 mg of soot (Printex U, a carbon black used as model soot) with 180 mg of catalyst or SiC for the reference non-catalytic test (catalyst:soot = 9:1) in loose contact. Feed gas contained 500 ppm of NO and 4% oxygen in a flow of N2 as balance gas, the total flow being 600 mL min−1. The tests were conducted between 200 °C and 700 °C with a ramp of 5 °C min−1. The soot conversion and CO2 selectivity were calculated as followed:                                                           (100)                                                                 Soot                                                                     conversion                                                                                                          %                                                                                                       =                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ∑                                                                                      0                                           t                                                                                (                                        C                                                                                   O                                           2                                                                                +                                        C                                        O                                        )                                                                                                                                                                                                           C                                                                                               O                                                 2                                                                                            +                                              C                                              O                                                                                                                                                                      t                                           o                                           t                                           a                                           l                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       (100)                                                                 C                                                                       O                                     2                                                                                                       selectivity                                                                                                          %                                                                    =                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ∑                                                                                      0                                           t                                                                                (                                        C                                                                                   O                                           2                                                                                )                                                                                                                                                                                                           C                                                                                               O                                                 2                                                                                            +                                              C                                              O                                                                                                                                                                      t                                           o                                           t                                           a                                           l\n"
